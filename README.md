## Introduction
Some new computers, such as those that use Intel Baytrail devices (eg. Teclast X98), have an uncommon 32-bit UEFI BIOS. Currently, the official Arch Linux installation iso image is not compatible with such devices as it either boots in 64-bit EFI mode or legacy BIOS mode - no 32-bit EFI mode.
